# Plantville
A data first approach to growing house plants. Hopefully made sort of fun and easy.  The overarching goal is to have beautiful abundant houseplants, with no personal effort.

## Overview
The project is composed of a planter in my windowsill with an automatic watering timer and lights.  A camera is perched above and connected to a raspberry Pi 5 that hosts a server receiving the feed.  The server periodically logs analytical data, images of the plants and serves the website.
